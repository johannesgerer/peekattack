<h1>peekAttack Webcam Chat with Random Strangers and Facebook support</h1>
peekAttack is a website that pairs random strangers from around the world together for webcam-based conversations. Visitors to the website randomly begin an online chat (video, audio and text) with another visitor. At any point, either user may leave the current chat by initiating another random connection.
The website uses Adobe Flash to display video and access the user's webcam. Flash's peer-to-peer network capabilities (via RTMFP) allow almost all video and audio streams to travel directly between user computers, without using server bandwidth. However, certain combinations of routers will not allow UDP traffic to flow between them, and then it is necessary to fall back to RTMP.[12]
According to one informal study published in March 2010,[13]  nearly half of all spins connected a user with someone in the USA, while the next most likely country was France with 15%.[13]  On average in sessions showing a single person, 89% of these were male and 11% were female. 8% of spins showed multiple people behind the camera. 1 in 3 females appeared as such a group. That number is 1 in 12 for males. A user was more likely to encounter a webcam featuring no person at all than one featuring a sole female. 1 in 8 spins yielded a penis or something else most people will consider objectionable. A user was twice as likely to encounter a sign requesting female nudity than to encounter actual female nudity.
Culture

A participant whose chat partner clicks the  Next button to move on to a new partner is described as being "nexted".[14]

Celebrities claiming to have used Chatroulette include Kelly Osbourne, Joel Madden, Nicole Richie, and Paris Hilton.[15][16]

On February 27, 2010 at the Soundwave Festival in Melbourne, Australia, Faith No More streamed their festival performance live on Chatroulette.[17]
